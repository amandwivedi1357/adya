                Adya’s Distributed Intelligence (DI) ushers in the next generation of the smart/active grid, providing a secure, open enterprise application platform with edge computing capability. Our innovative technology can address value-based use cases at the &grid;s edge, offering solutions that traditional systems &can;t.
                <br />
                <br />
                Adya is committed to maximizing the return on its Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) investments, while also planning for future enhancements in response to evolving technologies, burgeoning customer needs, and the demand for advanced grid management.
                <br />
                <br />
                Currently, Adya is diving into the realm of distributed intelligence meters with a proof-of-concept initiative. The aim is not only to grasp the workings of the DI ecosystem but also to test the &technology;s potential for future field deployment.
                <br />
                <br />
                As this marks Adya second foray into smart meter technology, the majority of the preliminary DI technology testing will be conducted in a controlled lab environment before transitioning the meters for field tests.
                <br />
                <br />
                To conduct the proof of concept accurately for DI use cases using edge-computing technology, Adya has introduced a new testing method using a Meter Electric Board (MEB). This tool enables the creation of iterative test sequences, manipulating variables such as voltage and current to mimic a range of electrical conditions encountered in the field.
